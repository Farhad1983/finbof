# Temporal Logistic Neural BoF method for Limit Order Book data analysis
Implementation of the Temporal Logistic Neural BoF method

This repository demonstrates how to use the Temporal Logistic Neural BoF method to classify limit order book data. Please  download the preprocessed data from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vvvqwfejyertr4q/lob.tar.xz?dl=0) and place the .h5 file into the data folder. You can then run the experiments by executing the [run_exps.py](https://github.com/passalis/finbof/blob/master/run_exps.py) file.
